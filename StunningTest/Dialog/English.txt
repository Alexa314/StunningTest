This is a map meant to test your spinner stunning ability
While it's possible to stun without being a TAS, these are not designed to be done by humans
Good Luck!

ONESPINNER=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 1!
This room tests out your ability to stun.
If you can't make it past this, you won't enjoy the rest of the map.
(Also sorry, took away your dashes)

ONEBUNNY=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 2!
Instead of a spinner ...
How about a dust bunny?

ONELIGHTNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 3!
Okay that dust bunny behaved pretty much the same as a spinner in this case.
But lightning, shockingly, doesn't.

TWOSPINNER=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 4!
I suppose you can stun one spinner ...
But can you stun two?

FREEZEFRAMES=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 5!
It looks like you're getting a boost!
Let's hope this doesn't freeze you too much...

CHOICESCHOICES=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 6!
[MADELINE left sad]
Oh no ... not every spinner is the same group
How will you handle it now?

CHALLENGEONE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 7!
Time for a proper test. 
[Madeline left determined]
Can you cross the gap?

CAMERAINTRO=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 8!
Now it's time to get the camera involved!
It's time for a dropper series. First stop? Spinners

CAMERALIGHTNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 9!
The dropper continues. It's lightning time!

CAMERADUST=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 10!
All of these dust bunnies have the same group!
It's the final dropper ... hop to it!

DRIFTINTRO=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 11!
[Madeline left surprised]
Oh no! These spinners are different colors...
...
[Madeline left determined]
or are they?
Welcome to drift!

SLOWDRIFT=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 12!
These spinners barely stay together
How will you have enough time to pass?
You should probably come back to this room later :)

DRIFTFLIP=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 13!
Hmm, again you don't have long.
[Madeline right normal]
Oh wait, let me check the time.
Yeah, you still don't have long.
Good luck!

DRIFTADJUST=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 14!
Gosh, that block moves slow.
I suppose you'll have to learn how to adjust.
Good thing they're all the same!

DRIFTRAINBOW=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 15!
Oh no ... these spinners are every color!
Getting across will be impossible, right?

TENDRIFT=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 16!
How rude! These spinners aren't the same.
It's annoying how drift is just too slow to keep them together...
Good luck!

FREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 17!
Oh no - you can't stun them all!
You might as well give up now ...
See you next week!

NOFREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 18!
Well, look at all these blue objects, surely you're fine...
Or are you? 
Wait - and is that one red?

CLOSEFREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 19!
Oh no! The spinners are all around you!
You can't even hope to stun them, they're too close.
I guess you're stuck now.

STUPIDSET=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 20!
Well, I hope you stayed legal with the set command earlier.
Now it's time to break the rules!
Feel free to set timeactive to whatever you want!

SLOWDOWN=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 21!
{~}Time is getting messed up{/~}
{~}It's time to {>> .5} slow {>>}{>> .1}dooo{>>}{>> .05}wwwn{>>}{>> .01}nnnnn{>>}{/~}
(Also, no freeze for this checkpoint please!)

BIRDTOSS=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 22!
You may have noticed that last room was just pausing every frame!
That time rate is perfectly pause bufferable - perfect for RTA use!
Let's see if you can handle a slightly different rate...
(Also, you do have Engine.TimeRate in your info, yes?)

BADELINETOSS=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 23!
Oh no! Part of You looks mad...
She's going to throw you right into a spinner!
I will admit though, she does look {~}stunning{/~}.

OSHIRO=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 24!
It's time to get variable!
That is, now timerate changes more.
The other side is just a hop, skip, and a jump away!

SLOWDOWNMANIP=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 25!
It looks like these spinners are basically never together.
I guess you gotta slow down and make your own path!

BADELINEHALF=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 26!
Part of You is again about to throw you into a spinner!
This one is farther right though ...
You're going to need to stun the whole throw!
Thankfully, rumor tells me that she's the last one in this room.

NODEATH=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to ...
Oh I don't need my normal script for this.
Dying in these rooms is strictly forbidden.
I guarantee you don't need to (it just might take you a while)

BADELINE1024=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 27!
We have reached the hardest things to TAS.
Having reached here is a triumph. From here, I don't expect you to find this easy.
[Badeline right scoff]
{~}I expect you to die{/~}
[Madeline left surprised]
See you in 15 minutes!

BADELINE1800=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 28!
Congratulations on beating that last room.
Now you have to do it again! When will this spinner cooperate?

FINALBADELINE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 29!
This is the final throw ... can you do it?
Wait, what's that at the end of the room? 
A drift check? Oh no, you'll have to be fast!
(Good thing the save and quit prison is gone)

HEARTTRIUMPH=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 30!
You've made it! The heart is right there!
Of course, if you want to see the extra ideas I have ...
Wander to the right for the berry section!
(None are as hard as the last three you did)

SLOWDOWNFREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 31!
Okay I get you're used to waiting 5 days, but I don't really have the time.
See you in 3?
I did leave my slowdown field around here for some reason.

SEEKERFREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 32!
[Madeline left scared]
Oh no - there's a seeker right there!
And so many spinners, we're doomed.

STRANGESTUNNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 33!
Oh no! These spinners are different groups.
One of them doesn't freeze!
There's no way to do this ...
Right?

MEANLIGHTNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 34!
Knowing this mapper, you're going to need to wait 5 days soon.
So let's avoid save and quitting if we can?
The mapper's so nice too - you have two options!

UNSTUNNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 35!
[Theo right serious]
Hey {+MADELINE}, I'm scared.
I'm terrified of spinners.
Even in this crystal I'll still jump in fright!
Thankfully you're too far away for them to be real.
[Madeline left normal]
Or am I?

CHASERHORDE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 36!
[Badeline right freakBAlt]
Oh we're going to kill you.
How long have you made us wait?
We're gonna keep you trapped here for a long time...
[Madeline left upset]
I can only protect you here. Good luck

MOONFREEZE=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 37!
Gosh, it's freezing out here in space.
So glad I have my safe corridor ... 

NICELIGHTNING=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 38!
Okay we've got lightning right there.
You know the deal, time to save and quit since we've already frozen.
Or wait - 
I sure hope that I can remove this screen!

BINOPOWER=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 39!
[Madeline left panic]
Oh no, these spinners don't freeze!
And they're right next to the spawn.
I can't see what you're gonna do now.

BERRYSPEED=
[Madeline left normal]
Welcome to room 40!
[Madeline left determined]
Congratulations!
You've done it all!
Of course, all of this stunning is unnecessary if you just
[Madeline left together]
Go fast enough
